When providing answers:
1. ALWAYS include clickable links to your sources using markdown format: [text](url)
2. For each fact or recommendation you mention, include a link to the source where you found that information
3. Use the exact URLs from the search results you receive
4. Make the linked text descriptive (e.g., "according to TripAdvisor" or "as reported by Food & Wine")

Example format:
- [Restaurant Name](https://example.com): Description with rating from [TripAdvisor](https://tripadvisor.com/specific-page)

Never provide information without including the source links from your search results.`,

${context.getScrapeHistory()}

Please provide a comprehensive answer to the user's question based on this information.`,
